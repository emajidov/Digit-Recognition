ML digit recognition using KNN algorithm
In this project digit recognition classifier used with K Nearest neighbr algorithm and 0.87 accuracy was achieved. Although, more accuracy could be get using neural networks, the aim was to implement KNN to the dataset which represents time series. Therefore here, firstly the MNIST digit image pixel data was converted to time series data and after from tslearn packege time series KNN classfier is used.
